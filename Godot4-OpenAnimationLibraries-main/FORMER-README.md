## UPDATE
Adobe's terms of service 6.2.E state not to make datasets or databases from their content which this could be seen as. 
To respect their service, I am removing the libraries. 
I will continue to provide the Godot bone map, and will create a new tutorial showing how to make your own probject libraries for your own individual games. 
Perhaps we can make own community open library of open animations. Thanks for your understanding.

## Features

Mixamo bone map and themed character libraries of Mixamo animations easily remapped to models in Godot that have a typical Mixamo skelelon

## Usage
Requires Godot 4.0.13 Alpha or newer

- Drop the Mixamo Bone Map.tres, and any -Library.res files you want into Godot
- Drop in any Mixamo rigged model, that was exported in the base Tpose
- Re-import with the Mixamo bone map.
- Drop into scene, right click and Make Local (or Save as scene)
- Open its animation player and select Animation > Manage Animations > Load Library > ...-library.res
- It's now mapped to the new character!
